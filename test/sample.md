Did you know that the first Hello World program was written by Brian Kernignan?
Here it is:

    main() {
        printf("hello, world");
    }

You can read all about it on [Wikipedia][1].

What a wonderful day. Got up, brushed my teeth. 

Pondered the meaning of life for a while.

Nothing eventful happened. Went to bed.
